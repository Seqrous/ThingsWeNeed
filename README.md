# ThingsWeNeed
A 3rd semester project introducing us to web development.

### Disclaimer ### 
The project's github management was a mess.
While developing the project, we were the only people 
who understood how it worked. Now I don't think anybody does :/

## Frameworks and technologies we have worked with:
- .NET,
- ASP.NET,
- Entity Framework,
- ASP.NET Razor
