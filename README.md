# ThingsWeNeed
A 3rd semester project introducing us to web development.

### Overview:
On the 3rd semester we have been introduced to networking with the aim of developing a web application later on. Our group's goal was to implement an application that would act as a shopping list. Basically, you were supposed to be able to create an account, join a household (representing your real life home) and suggest what should be bought either for mutual or personal use. Since, we were all green when it came to knowing what an API was and how to implement server side of the application, the development turned out to be very complicated. Lacking experience using Git wasn't helpful either.

### Disclaimer ### 
The project's github management was a mess.
While developing the project, we were the only people 
who understood how it worked. Now I don't think anybody does :/

## Frameworks and technologies we have worked with:
- .NET,
- ASP.NET,
- Entity Framework,
- ASP.NET Razor
