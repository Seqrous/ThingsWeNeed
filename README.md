# ThingsWeNeed
A 3rd semester project introducing us to web development.

The project's github management was a mess.
While developing the project, we were the only people 
who understood how it worked. Now I don't think anybody does :v

## Languages included, which we practiced/learned along the way:
- C#,
- JS, 
- HTML,
- CSS,
- SQL

## Frameworks and technologies we have worked with:
- .NET,
